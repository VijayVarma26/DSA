### Problem Statement: Maximum Subarray Sum

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within the array. A subarray is a sequence of elements taken from the array in the same order but must be continuous.

---

### Requirements:
1. Identify the contiguous subarray that produces the highest possible sum.
2. If all numbers in the array are negative, return the largest (least negative) single value.

---

### Input:
- An integer array `array` of size `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)).
- The elements of the array can range from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).

---

### Output:
- A single integer representing the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.

---

### Example Inputs and Outputs:

1. **Input:** `array = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]`  
   **Output:** `6`  
   **Explanation:** The contiguous subarray `[4, -1, 2, 1]` has the maximum sum of `6`.

2. **Input:** `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`  
   **Output:** `15`  
   **Explanation:** The entire array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` has the maximum sum of `15`.

3. **Input:** `array = [-1, -2, -3, -4]`  
   **Output:** `-1`  
   **Explanation:** The single element `[-1]` is the maximum sum for this case.

---

### Constraints:
1. The algorithm must run in \(O(n)\) time complexity to handle large input sizes efficiently.
2. The solution should work for arrays with both positive and negative values.
