An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another, using all the original letters exactly once. The **Anagram Problem Statement** is a common programming exercise that involves checking or manipulating strings based on this property. Below is a generic problem statement:


### Problem Statement:  
**Check if Two Strings are Anagrams**

Write a function that determines whether two given strings are anagrams of each other. The function should return `True` if the strings are anagrams, and `False` otherwise.

### Input:  
Two strings, `str1` and `str2`.  
- Strings may contain spaces and special characters.
- Comparison should be case-insensitive.

### Output:  
A boolean value indicating whether the two strings are anagrams.

### Constraints:  
1. The function should handle strings of varying lengths.
2. Ignore spaces, punctuation, and case while comparing the strings.

### Examples:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** `"listen"`, `"silent"`  
- **Output:** `True`  
**Explanation:** Both strings contain the same letters with the same frequency.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** `"hello"`, `"world"`  
- **Output:** `False`  
**Explanation:** The two strings contain different letters.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:** `"Astronomer"`, `"Moon starer"`  
- **Output:** `True`  
**Explanation:** After removing spaces and ignoring case, both strings are anagrams.

#### Example 4:
- **Input:** `"The eyes"`, `"They see"`  
- **Output:** `True`
