**Problem Statement: Sentence Reversal**

Write a program that takes a sentence as input and reverses the order of words in the sentence. The program should preserve the spacing between words and handle edge cases like multiple spaces and empty input gracefully.

### **Requirements:**
1. Accept a string input containing a sentence with words separated by spaces.
2. Reverse the order of words in the sentence while keeping the individual words unchanged.
3. Maintain the spacing between words, including leading, trailing, and multiple spaces.
4. If the input is an empty string or contains only spaces, return the same string.
5. Remove spaces from start and end in the sentences

**Example Inputs and Outputs:**

1. **Input:** `"Hello World!"`  
   **Output:** `"World! Hello"`

2. **Input:** `"  Python is awesome  "`  
   **Output:** `"awesome is Python"`

3. **Input:** `"a b c"`  
   **Output:** `"c b a"`

4. **Input:** `""`  
   **Output:** `""`

5. **Input:** `"    "`  
   **Output:** `"    "`

**Constraints:**
- The input string may contain letters, numbers, punctuation, and spaces.
- Ensure that time and space complexity are optimized for large inputs.
